# Uninstallation Process Improvements

## Problem
Previously, the uninstallation process had the following issues:

1. Did not terminate running instances of the application
2. Did not properly clean up all installed components
3. Left residual processes that could lead to ghost status bar icons

## Solution

The uninstallation process has been improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Process Termination**: The uninstall script now kills any running instances of the application before removal
2. **Comprehensive File Cleanup**: All files including desktop entries, icons, and systemd services are properly removed
3. **Service Management**: Systemd services are properly stopped and disabled before removal
4. **Proper Debian Package Handling**: For system-wide installations, the Debian package is removed correctly
5. **Enhanced Cleanup**: Added proper service file with ExecStop to ensure clean termination

## Checking for Leftover Processes

After uninstallation, you can verify that no leftover processes exist by running:

```bash
ps aux | grep reminder
```

You should only see the grep command itself in the results.

## Checking for Leftover Files

To check if any important application files remain after uninstallation:

```bash
# Check for executable
which reminder

# Check for desktop files
ls ~/.local/share/applications/reminder.desktop
ls /usr/share/applications/reminder.desktop

# Check for autostart entries
ls ~/.config/autostart/reminder-autostart.desktop
ls /etc/xdg/autostart/reminder-autostart.desktop

# Check for systemd services
ls ~/.config/systemd/user/reminder.service
ls /usr/lib/systemd/user/reminder.service
```

None of these files should exist after a complete uninstallation.
